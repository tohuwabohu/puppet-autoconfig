##2016-XX-YY - Release 2.0.0
###Summary

The module has been changed significantly and won't provide a default vhost web server configuration any more. Instead
it will provide a simple `.htaccess` file which allows to use one single vhost configuration to serve an unrestricted
number of autoconfig domains. Please have a look at the README file for a full configuration guide.
